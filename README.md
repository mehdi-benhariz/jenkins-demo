## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of Jenkins in automating the build, test, and deployment phases of a software development lifecycle. By leveraging Jenkins, we aim to achieve continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for our applications, ensuring that new code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to the production environment seamlessly.

### Key Features

- **Automated Builds:** Automatically trigger builds on new code commits.
- **Continuous Testing:** Run automated tests to ensure code quality.
- **Seamless Deployment:** Automatically deploy the application to the production environment after successful builds and tests.

This demo project is a starting point for understanding how Jenkins can be integrated into a development workflow to improve efficiency and productivity.

## Getting Started
